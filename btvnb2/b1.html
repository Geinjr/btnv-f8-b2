        <p>
            This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about cooking technique
            called sous vide. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerde the
            food(usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a wter bath thar is
            aprecisele set to the target temperature you want the food to be
            cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking fir Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter
            describes ir as " ultra-low temperature poaching".

            Next month, we will be serving
            <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dil Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a
            seat ar the chef table, contact us before November 30.
